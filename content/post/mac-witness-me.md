Earlier this week, I uncovered and dusted off my White Macbook purchased back in 2007. It's really an amazingly built machine - still booted up like a champ 10 years later.

On the other hand, the software is evidently drawing its last breath. It was running OS X Lion 10.7, more than a few years old at this point. The hardware is still more than enough perform basic tasks - however, the OS was so outdated that most modern websites simply do not work anymore.

At this point I have a couple of options - I can either junk the machine, or attempt to breath new life into it by upgrading the OS. With this machine, OS X 10.8 is the latest version it supports - not good enough given this version is quite old itself.
