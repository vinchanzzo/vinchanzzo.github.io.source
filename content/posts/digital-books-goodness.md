Even though modern technology has made digital storage a commodity and accessible to nearly everybody, I still find it mind-boggling to comprehend the amount of information that could be stored digitally.

With the storage space we have nowadays, one could easily host a electronic world of books and literature and not be able to go through them all in a lifetime. In a way, this drove my fascination and slight obsession in collecting ebooks.

If you know where to look, there's definitely an abundance of resources for downloading ebooks. However, where there is quantity, quality becomes a challenge: some texts are simply OCR'd and not corrected, the layout and setting could be off, rendering the texts unreadable; missing page, scrambled texts... etc.

Here are a few decent resources I've come across:

[Standard Books](https://standardebooks.org/)

[Archive.org Harvard Classics](https://archive.org/details/harvardclassics)

[My Harvard Classics](https://www.myharvardclassics.com/categories/20120212)

Will keep updating this list as I come across new quality sources.
