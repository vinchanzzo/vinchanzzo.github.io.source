Earlier this week I dusted off my Macbook I purchased back in 2007 (Macbook 2,1). It's really an amazingly machine - still booted up like a champ 10 years later.  

On the other hand, the software is evidently drawing its last breath. OS X Lion 10.7 few years old at this point. The hardware is still more than enough perform basic tasks, so I set out to find out what I could do with it.

Then I came across [CloudReady](https://www.neverware.com) - built on [ChromiumOS](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os), an open-source variant of OS that powers [ChromeBook](https://www.google.com/chromebook/).  

Setup was very easy - the bulk of the work is creating a bootable USB stick, which is used to start up a "live" version of CloudReady which you can then install from.  

So far I've fairly happy with the results - for light web-browsing and Netflix, it's a perfect device. Definitely saves the old machine from certain fate.  

More on this later...
