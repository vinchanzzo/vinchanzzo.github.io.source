My current laptop is a strong but aging Lenovo Y510p. Apart from the fairly capable CPU and Nvidia SLI GPU, the rest of the setup is pretty lackluster and did not stand well against time. So I embarked on a slow but steady journey of upgrading the machine to give it a few good years of life.

First, I swapped out the internal 2.5" HDD with an SSD - and what a difference it made. The performance when it comes to daily use is just night and day - I wish I've done it sooner.

The next upgrade on the list is the wifi, which unfortunately operates at 2.4ghz and wireless b/g. The 2.4ghz frequency is definitely not an ideal frequency to operate at, since it's probably the standard frequency everyone and their grandma's wireless devices operates on - guaranteed interference and signal degradation, especially if you work in a dense area.

I would have preferred swapping out the laptop's wifi card, however due to another unfortunate decision by Lenovo to whitelist only selected hardware in the BIOS, is not an easy task to find replacement parts for a 5 year old laptop. So I opted for an inexpensive USB wifi adapter.

Since I have my 2.4ghz and 5ghz wifi network on the same SSID (the only way I could get devices on the two different frequencies to talk to each other - *cough* First-gen Chromecast *cough*), I had to make sure my USB wifi adapter only connects via the 5ghz network. There is usually a setting of some form to ensure this - on Windows 10, look under the Advance tab of the network adapter device configuration. There is usually a "Prefer 5ghz" option of some sort - if not, you can specify the adapter to only use Wifi AC, which should connect to the 5ghz only.

So far so good!
