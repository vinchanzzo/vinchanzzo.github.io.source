This tip should work for any Xiaomi device running MIUI 9 (tested on 9.5.4.0 Global Stable).

I came across this setting while exploring activities via [Activity Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.szalkowski.activitylauncher).

Essentially this opens up the Power Mode menu which lets you pick between Balance Mode (default) / Performance Mode.

I could be mistakened but I believe this menu is hidden in MIUI (or buried somewhere I couldn't find) but shown on stock and other variants of Android.

[Performance Mode](https://i.imgur.com/C9l8jYL.jpg)

I've tested the difference between the two modes for quite some time now, and Performance mode does make the phone noticeably snappier and smoother. That said, it does seem to use more power and I would say reduced my SOT by about 30mins on average - small tradeoff in my case with the powerhouse that is Max 2.

So far so good - nice little tweak to get a bit more performance out of the device!
