[American Gods](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1898069/) is my current TV addiction and my new favorite show.

Developed by the same producer responsible for the Mads Mikkelsen [Hannibal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243973/), it's got the same dreamy quality throughout, with consistent doses of stylistic violence.

It just gets better episode after episode. Highly recommended - watch it on Amazon Prime Video in Canada.
