        <p>I love <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoi8iH0e_SAhUJjVQKHZN3ACEQFggnMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPrime-Video%2Fb%3Fnode%3D2676882011&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkHJS3badZSj510hfX4kB31AwBKg">Amazon and its Prime service</a>.</p>

<p>It really changed the way I shopped - the one / two-day shopping is fantastic. At one point in time, I was a subscriber to both Amazon Prime Canada and Amazon Prime US, just to get access to the market place across the border (unfortunately the Canadian selection is just not up to par).</p>

<p>This convenience and new way of shopping really creates an interesting problem - the excess of packaging. It is common to have make an order consisting of multiple items, but shipped to you in different packaging and boxes - I suppose logistically the items come from different warehouses, so as an effort to ship it faster, they were sent in its own packaging.</p>

<p>The result is a rapidly-filled recycling and trash bin, with things like bubble wraps, air packets etc, going into the latter. Not something I&rsquo;m very proud of.</p>

<p>I would love it if there is some creative solution to this - perhaps an option for an &ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; shipping where items are consolidated into one lean, smart packaging, but at an expense of slower shipping time? Not sure if many consumers would go for that, but I would do it for orders that makes sense.</p>
